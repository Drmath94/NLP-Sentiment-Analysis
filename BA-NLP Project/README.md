# Sentiment-Driven Insights: Analyzing British Airways Customer Reviews Using Web Scraping and NLP

Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback for British Airways using web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques. I began by scraping customer reviews from trusted review platforms using Python and BeautifulSoup to gather unstructured text data. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from the reviews.

A key component of the project was the development of a sentiment classification pipeline that automatically determines whether a customer statement is positive, negative, or neutral. I experimented with several machine learning algorithms including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to build and compare classification models.

The pipeline enables efficient sentiment tagging of new reviews and provides actionable insights into customer experiences, helping identify strengths and areas for improvement in British Airways' service delivery.
